# 
# # A.  Summarize the original real-data research question you identified in task 1. Your summary should include justification for the research question you identified in task 1, a description of the context in which the research question exists, and a discussion of your hypothesis.
# 
# My research question is "To what extent do transaction amount, transaction date and time, merchant category, cardholder geographic location, and card type affect the prediction of fraudulent transactions?"
# 
# In 2024, fraud detection remains a critical challenge as cybercriminals continuously evolve their methods to circumvent traditional security measures. The increasing complexity and sophistication of fraud require more robust and dynamic detection systems. Many find it helpful to, at this point, pause and reflect on the main ideas surrounding the advancement in fraud detection technologies and their implications for financial security. The PFERD project addresses this need by developing a model capable of accurately predicting fraudulent transactions, thus providing a pertinent solution to contemporary fraud challenges.
# 
# Null Hypothesis (H0): The variables (transaction amount, transaction date and time, merchant category, cardholder geographic location, card type) do not statistically significantly affect the prediction of fraudulent transactions.
# 
# Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The variables (transaction amount, transaction date and time, merchant category, cardholder geographic location, card type) statistically significantly affect the prediction of fraudulent transactions.

# # B.  Report on your data-collection process by describing the relevant data you collected, discussing one advantage and one disadvantage of the data-gathering methodology you used, and discussing how you overcame any challenges you encountered during the process of collecting your data.
# 
# My data collection process involved comparing credit card datasets avaialable online. One challenge I faced was that credit card information is highly sensitive, and therefore I could only find two types of credit card data:
# 
# 1) Data which has been obfuscated and the columns consist of anonymized features representing various transaction attributes. Datasets like these have the advantage of representing real variations in customer behavior, however, the anonymization of variables makes it difficult to explain one's findings. The alternative is:
# 2) Simulated data which includes useful column names. One major and obvious disadvantage of using a simulated dataset is that it isn't based on real-world occurances and therefore lacks some complexity and variability. This can lead to developing a model which may be accurate when working with a simulated dataset, but can fail to be useful when applied to non-simulated data. For example, throughout the MSDA program, I chose to use the telecommunications churn data, and one major sign of simulation was the age distribution of customers. While the ages were evenly distributed, this is not representative of the overall US population and older age groups were heavily overrepresented.
# 
# In order to create a model which can be discussed and visualized for my capstone project, I chose to go with the second option and selected [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud/data) from Kaggle, a data science competition platform.
# 
# The dataset has 29 columns: a unique identifier (id) and 28 anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("card_transdata.csv")
df.head()


# The primary advantage of using this dataset is that it represents real variations in customer behavior, despite the anonymization. This aspect ensures that the dataset maintains the complexity and variability inherent in actual credit card transactions. By using this dataset, I can build a model that captures the underlying patterns and trends associated with credit card fraud, which is crucial for developing robust predictive models.
# 
# Had I chosen the anonymized dataset, a significant disadvantage would have been that the anonymization of variables makes it challenging to explain findings in an intuitive and interpretable manner. The lack of meaningful variable names and the inability to directly relate features to real-world entities can hinder the interpretability of the model's results. This limitation makes it difficult to draw actionable insights and explain the model's decisions to stakeholders who may not be familiar with data science.
# 
# In summary, my data collection process involved selecting an anonymized dataset from Kaggle that captures real variations in credit card transactions. The advantage of this methodology is its ability to represent actual customer behavior, while the disadvantage lies in the difficulty of explaining the findings due to anonymization. By choosing simulated data, I was able to overcome the challenge of data sensitivity and create a model that can be effectively discussed and visualized for my capstone project.
# 
# # C.  Describe your data-extraction and -preparation process and provide screenshots to illustrate each step. Explain the tools and techniques you used for data extraction and data preparation, including how these tools and techniques were used on the data. Justify why you used these particular tools and techniques, including one advantage and one disadvantage when they are used with your data-extraction and -preparation methods. 
# 
# My data preparation process was very straightforward.
# 
# I started by examining the dataset and converting Boolean values stored as floats into proper Boolean types using Pandas. This step was crucial to ensure that the data types were correctly set, which can help prevent issues during model training and evaluation.
# 
# To further explore the dataset, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. For continuous variables, I plotted their distributions using histograms with Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). These visualizations helped me understand the data's distribution and identify any potential outliers or patterns. For Boolean variables, I created pie charts to show the proportion of each category. This visual approach provided a clear overview of the data and highlighted the distribution of values within each variable.
# 
# The summary statistics for each variable, generated using Pandas' describe function, offered additional insights into the dataset. These statistics, combined with the visualizations, ensured a comprehensive understanding of the data, setting a solid foundation for further analysis and modeling. This process, while straightforward, was essential for preparing the data correctly and effectively.

Justify how you selected the analysis technique(s) you used, including one advantage and one disadvantage of these technique(s).
# 
# The data analysis process for the credit card fraud dataset involved using logistic regression, a reliable technique for binary classification problems. Logistic regression was a fitting choice for this task as it effectively models the probability of a binary outcome based on multiple predictor variables.
# 
# First, I split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. This step was crucial to ensure the model's evaluation on unseen data, providing a more accurate estimate of its performance. I then saved these training and testing datasets to CSV files for reproducibility.
# 
# Next, I initialized a logistic regression model and trained it using the training dataset. Once the model was trained, I made predictions on the testing dataset. Various evaluation metrics were calculated to assess the model's performance, including accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC AUC score, Brier score, log-likelihood, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Cohen's Kappa. These metrics were stored in a dictionary, converted to a DataFrame, and then saved to a CSV file for easy reference.
# 
# The summary of metrics indicated strong model performance, with high accuracy and robust evaluation scores. For instance, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.87%, with a near-perfect ROC AUC score of 0.9999. These results demonstrated the model's ability to accurately predict fraudulent transactions.
# 
# To further validate the model's performance, I plotted the ROC curve and calculated the AUC (Area Under the Curve). The ROC curve visually represents the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate at various threshold settings. The AUC score, which was nearly perfect at 0.9999, indicates the model's excellent ability to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. This visualization reinforces the robustness and reliability of the logistic regression model in predicting credit card fraud.
# 
# Logistic regression was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. It offers interpretable coefficients, which makes it easier to understand the relationship between predictor variables and the probability of fraud. Additionally, it is computationally efficient and well-suited for relatively small datasets. However, one disadvantage is its assumption of a linear relationship between predictor variables and the log-odds of the target variable. This assumption might not always hold true, potentially limiting the model's performance if the actual relationship is non-linear.

# # E.  Summarize the implications of your data analysis by discussing the results of your data analysis in the context of the research question, including one limitation of your analysis. Within the context of your research question, recommend a course of action based on your results. Then propose two directions or approaches for future study of the data set.
# 
# The primary objective of this analysis was to develop a model capable of accurately predicting credit card fraud. Using logistic regression, we achieved a high level of accuracy, with the model demonstrating a 99.87% accuracy rate. The ROC AUC score of 0.9999 further highlights the model's ability to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions effectively. Additionally, other metrics such as the Brier Score (0.0012), Log-Likelihood (-0.0012), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (0.9973), and Cohen's Kappa (0.9959) underscore the robustness of the model.
# 
# The research question driving this analysis was: "To what extent do transaction amount, transaction date and time, merchant category, cardholder geographic location, and card type affect the prediction of fraudulent transactions?" The results of this analysis directly address this question by demonstrating that the logistic regression model, which includes these key variables, can predict fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
# 
# **Given the strong performance metrics, the analysis suggests that these variables indeed have a significant impact on the prediction of fraudulent transactions. This outcome supports the alternate hypothesis (H1) that the variables statistically significantly affect the prediction of fraudulent transactions, while rejecting the null hypothesis (H0) that they do not.**
# 
# The confusion matrix revealed that the model had very few false positives (2) and false negatives (4), with true positives (274) and true negatives (199720) being correctly identified. These results indicate that the model performs well in identifying both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
# 
# One limitation of this analysis is the use of a simulated dataset. While the dataset includes features that represent real-world scenarios, it does not capture the full complexity and variability of actual credit card transactions. This limitation means that while the model performs exceptionally well on the simulated data, its effectiveness in real-world applications may vary. Additionally, the assumption of a linear relationship between predictor variables and the log-odds of the target variable in logistic regression might not hold in all cases, potentially affecting model performance.
# 
# Based on the results of this analysis, the recommended course of action is to deploy the logistic regression model in a controlled environment to monitor its performance on real-world data. This pilot phase will allow for the assessment of the model's effectiveness in a practical setting and enable adjustments based on observed discrepancies or patterns. Regular updates and retraining of the model with new data will be crucial to maintaining its accuracy and relevance.
# 
# To address the limitation of using a simulated dataset, future studies should incorporate real-world credit card transaction data. This approach will help in validating the model's performance and ensuring its applicability in practical scenarios. Collaborating with financial institutions to obtain anonymized real-world data could significantly enhance the model's robustness.
# 
# In 2024, fraud detection remains a critical challenge as cybercriminals continuously evolve their methods to circumvent traditional security measures. The increasing complexity and sophistication of fraud require more robust and dynamic detection systems. The findings from this analysis underscore the importance of leveraging detailed transaction data to build effective fraud detection models. The PFERD project addresses this need by developing a model capable of accurately predicting fraudulent transactions, thus providing a pertinent solution to contemporary fraud challenges.
# 
# While logistic regression provided excellent results, exploring more advanced machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Deep Learning could potentially yield even better performance. These methods can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features, offering a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to credit card fraud. Comparative studies between these models and logistic regression would provide valuable insights into the best approach for fraud detection.
